#What is NHIC School Management?

# It is a school management system designed and developed specifically for NHIC so teachers
# can offer their students online learning while parents can track their students' progress.
# It also allows NHIC school administrators to faciliate and manage school operations
# The project is still under development and will release as a beta project to test the app
